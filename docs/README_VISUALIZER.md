# Tana Graph Visualizer

Inspired by the marketing visualization on the Tana.inc website, `tana-helper` provides a 3D visualization of your Tana workspace.

Check out this [video demo](https://share.cleanshot.com/VY0zm55s) and this

The visualizer displays nodes in the color of their associated tags and now includes a legend explaining the color assignments.

## Building

The visualizer UI requires you to build a TypeScript webapp using `yarn`

If you haven't already done so from the instruction on the [top-level README](./README.md), follow these instructions:

Install yarn first, then:

`yarn install`  (downloads all `npm` packages required)

`yarn build` (generates the required `.js` files in `./dist`)

After that, you should be able to hit the url `http://localhost:8000/ui/graph` in your web browser. Use the left sidebar menu to upload your Tana JSON export.

## Notes

The graph visualizer does NOT store your Tana graph on the server when you upload. Instead, whenever you upload a new json export file, it re-uploads your graph, the server processes it according to the new settings, and the resulting JSON required for visualization is returned to the browser where it is rendered.

The filtering /searching is then done on the browser side for speed.

## Graph processing API

If you're curious, the app POSTs your Tana JSON dump file to the `/graph` endpoint which returns a JSON response consisting of an array of `nodes[]` and `links[]`. These are then rendered by the amazing [3D Force-Directed Graph library](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph). You can use this endpoint for other experiments of your own if you want to process the graph yourself.
